#TODO: add some functionality for looping enemy patterns

#this autoload holds a bunch of references to enemies.
#you know, im getting a lot of these like "assigns a bunch of nodes to a string then instantiates them"
#kinds of things. i mean, they're all marginally different, but im sure theres some kind of inheritance i could
#do to make things more efficient.
#whatever. i feel like they're all marginally different so itd be a pain to combine them for now.
#anyways, i dont know if i have time to completely reconstruct the way im doing this stuff before the jam...
#so whatever! ill just do things the way i know.

#gonna be an array of PackedScenes holding references to enemy nodes.
#i want something similar to the text_queue where i can just pass in a string and a dictionary for each "command"
#maybe cause i want to have different kinds of commands baked into there, right?

#the goal of this is to have an enemy spawner. just an array holding commands for spawning enemies mainly.
#but there are other commands relevant to enemy spawning that i want to be able to have, so if i wanted to be able
#to write a queue of enemies just in like data, id have to have that data stored somewhere.
#in a locationbased platformer, you could do it in the window, cause you could just be like "this enemy is here, and 
#that enemy is there." but when you have something on a timer, and the level is less about location and more about 
#timing, i think an array makes sense. again, things like pauses, waiting for a specific event to trigger the 
#next event, those are commands that id want to be a part of the array.
#so i think the string dict thing is pretty elegant.
