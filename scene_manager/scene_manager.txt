i want some sort of extremely basic system to handle the switching of scenes.

i mean, its pretty dumbed down as it is in godot

but i want something a little more organized.

something really similar to the way the music_player handles things honestly lol

just like, type in a string, and load in that scene, maybe some transition effects with like

a color rect. and keeping track of how many scenes are loaded, getting rid of the last one, etc.

it might even only be for like the title screen or something. but itd be nice.


Add a basic title screen, intro, and a settings screen
