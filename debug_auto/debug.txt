ok for now, can still add as needed. to be honest this isnt a super necessary one anyways. 
its not like print does anything bad other than gum up error messages.
i just added a couple tags. nothing crazy. i can add whatever tags i need when the time comes.

just to print db messages, and use the row keys for debugging input
