#TODO: needs more work i think idk
#TODO: when spawning from the enemy loader script, i want some way to manipulate simple bullet.
#or i can just have a few different versions of the enemy. which would probably be easier.


#so i fixed the acceleration! by removing it... i just dont think it would work with the whole frame skipping thing.
#so ill just do the accelerations manually by changing the velocity at certain points.
#which will work with non adjustable movements. but how would i do something that would follow a certain
#object, or have some sort of parameter of movement dependent on something else?
#if i wanted something like wind, i could just put two bullet scripts on top of each other, and have one script 
#move in the opposite direction.
