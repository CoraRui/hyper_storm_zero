class_name node_comm_set

#this node should hold a bunch of commands so that the node_executor can steal them. i really dont think this is necessary, it should just be able to rip
#the nodes out from the children of any node, but i felt like there might be some use for this. so whatever!
#this is just the node itself. i think ill just use the script and throw it into various command set nodes
