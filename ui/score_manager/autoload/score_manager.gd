#autoload that keeps a score and displays it in the screen. can define whatever behavior of the score id like 
#to adapt to whatever id like

#TODO: pretty simple but pretty decent already. maybe add some sound effects for adding points? nah.
#maybe the +new_points thing under the score bar though, and some kind of scrolling increase as the points go up
#rather than a static points thing. also try to implement some kind of combo system, even if you dont end up using it,
#just to see how you might do it.
