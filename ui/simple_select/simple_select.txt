simple select works with three things:
	
	simple_select
	groups
	options
	
	the simple select object contains everything, and reads player input.
	
	the group object contains a set of options which can be selected by the player.
	each option can point to a different group which will be focused on when the option is selected.
	
	each option contains signals to perform different tasks.
	
	you have to reset like ALL OF THE FUCKING exports cause you're creating new things. whatever, deal with it.

	good enough for now
